# web-ifc-experiment

Repo for testing gpu picking with [web-ifc](https://github.com/tomvandig/web-ifc)
Work here might end up as seperate packages or part of [web-ifc-viewer](https://github.com/agviegas/web-ifc-viewer)
Will use [web-ifc-three](https://github.com/tomvandig/web-ifc-three) to find out how some of the stuff work..

Warning, this will have a lot of weird stuff :-)

What I want to have working (and might fail at getting to work)
