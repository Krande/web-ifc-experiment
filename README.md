# web-ifc-experiment

This was a repo where I tried gpu picking, but used way more memory, so moved away from it
Prser used is [web-ifc](https://github.com/tomvandig/web-ifc)
Work here might end up as seperate packages or part of [web-ifc-viewer](https://github.com/agviegas/web-ifc-viewer)

Warning, this will have a lot of weird stuff :-)

What I want to have working (and might fail at getting to work)
